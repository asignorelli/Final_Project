For our final project, we needed to argue the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh. We believe the best one is the one with the most stuff to do outdoors! To determine this, we counted the amount of Parks, Pools, and Courts and Rinks in each neighborhood.

# Datasets used
The Pool dataset shows the name, type, and location of every pool in Pittsburgh. We used it to find which neighborhoods have pools.
